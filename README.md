Transparency Above All â€“ Contractor AI
We have developed a solution to reduce corruption and fraud in public procurement by increasing transparency, ensuring the proper delivery of essential public goods and services to citizens.

Objective:
Increase transparency in Paraguay's public procurement processes by providing micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with real-time, AI-powered insights into tenders, helping them bid more efficiently and identify irregularities.

Key Features:

AI-Powered Predictive Model: Fine-tuned multilingual BERT transformer to analyze historical tender data and predict fair pricing.

Real-Time Monitoring: Helps bidders detect anomalies and file effective complaints.

User Focus: Targets MSMEs, unlike past initiatives that focused only on civic monitoring.

Stakeholders & Partnerships:

Primary Users: MSMEs bidding on public contracts.

Key Partners:

VIGIA (civic monitoring platform with 400+ users).

ASEPY (business association with 6,500+ members).

REACCION (youth-led anti-corruption group).

Open Contracting Partnership (OCP) (global transparency advocate).

Government Ally: National Directorate for Public Contracts (DNCP), supporting Paraguayâ€™s new law mandating 20% of contracts go to MSMEs.

Scalability:

Applicable in 8+ Latin American countries using OCDS open data standards.

Expandable via ASELA (200,000+ entrepreneurs across 11 countries).

Government Cooperation:

Positioned as a support tool for compliance with transparency laws.

Engages local governments struggling to meet MSME procurement quotas.

Awareness & Adoption:

Initial rollout to VIGIAâ€™s 400+ users, then ASEPYâ€™s 6,500+ members.

Promoted as part of VIGIAâ€™s existing toolkit for contractors.

Risk Mitigation:

Complaints can be filed anonymously via Paraguayâ€™s Public Contracting Information System (SICP).

VIGIA and ASEPY can escalate complaints if needed.

Data Integrity:

Sources from DNCPâ€™s open data portal, a global OCDS reference.

Team & Sustainability:

Experienced team from Observatorio Fiscal (Colombia), VIGIA, ASEPY, and tech developers.

Long-term funding secured through VIGIA and ASEPYâ€™s existing programs.

Impact:
More competitive & fair bidding for MSMEs.

Stronger anti-corruption oversight in public procurement.

Scalable model for Latin America.

This solution leverages AI + open data + civic engagement to make Paraguayâ€™s procurement system more transparent and inclusive. ðŸš€
